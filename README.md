# Nanaput World - Multiplayer Fighting Game

## About the project
Welcome! 😁
This is a server-based multiplayer 2D combat game. Up to 2 players can play in a lobby until one's health reaches zero, as shown below:

The objective of this project was to explore game development, and acquire experience working with a server. Moreover, we aimed to create a fun game that reminisces the superpowers we imagined we had when playing as kids 💪🦹 (in fact, the background of the game was inspired by our childhood playground).

As there are improvements to be made to the game, the project is still in development. 

## Built using:
* C# programming language
* Unity Engine
* Photon Engine's PUN 2 (for the server)
* Photoshop (for the sprites)
